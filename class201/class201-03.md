## Duckett HTML & CSS:
### Chapter 3: “Lists”
<!-- (pp.62-73) -->
There are three (3) different list types in HTML
1. Ordered Lists (numbered list) `<ol>`
   - each item is represented by a list item `<li>`
2. Unordred Lists (bulleted list) `<ul>`
   - each item is represented by a list item `<li>`
3. Definition Lists (terms w/ definitions)
   - `<dl>`: definition list element, wraps all terms and definitions
   - `<dt>`: definition term, wraps the term
   - `<dd>`: definition, wraps the definition

### Chapter 13: “Boxes” 
<!-- (pp.300-329) -->
CSS provides each HTML element it's own box. For each box we can control the size, border, padding, and margin.

Size is controlled:
- width, height: basic size control (pixels, %, etc)
- min-width, min-height: the smallest allowable size for a box (when not using a fixed size like %)
- max-width, max-height: maximum allowable size for a box (when not using a fixed size like %)
  
Content that doesn't fit within the box is called overflow, which is controlled:
- hidden: hides extra content
- scroll: puts a scroll bar in place

Borders - separates boxes from each other
- border-width: thickness of the border
- border-style: solid, dotted, dashed etc line styles
- border-color: ...color...
- border: shorthand that allows all three above to be specified in one line
    ```
    border: 2px solid red;
    ```

Padding:  space from border to content inside
 - top, right, bottom, left: all affect respective padding size
Margin: space from boarder to another box outside
 - top, right, bottom, left: all affect respective margin size
 - centering boxes use **auto** for left and right values

Other features:
- Display:  convert block element to inline and vice versa, make both, or none
- Visibility: show the block or not
- border-image
- box-shadow
- boarder-radius 


## Duckett JAVASCRIPT & JQUERY:
### Chapter 2: “Basic JavaScript Instructions”
<!-- (pp.70-73) -->
- Arrays: stores multiple values separated by commas
  -  `let array = [value1, value2, value 3];`
  -  index starts at position 0
  -  methods can be applied to arrays

### Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops”
<!-- from switch statements on (pp.162-182) -->
Switch statments can be used as an alternative for if/else statements in certain scenarios.

Switch statements are stuctured as follows:
```
switch(variable_being_cycled){
    case 'alternate_value_for_variable':
        code to be executed;
        additional code to be executed;
        break;
    default:
        code to be executed;
}
```
- switch(): calls the function on a variable
- case: defines the value being evaluated for that variable, would typically have multiple cases in a switch statement
- break: stops code below the break from being executed
- default: code that will execute if value is called that isn't expected

JavaScript (weak typing language) will use type coercion to make sense of a datatype. Be aware of this as this can cause unexpected bugs.
 - use strict operators `===` and `!==`

Truthy and Falsy Values:
- Falsy: false, 0, empty strings, NaN, undefined
  - treated as false
- Truthy: all other values...
  - treated as true

Loops
- for:
  - three inputs: variable initialization, condition, increment
  - used when you know how many times you want to loop through
- while:
  - condition (variable declared outside)
  - need a way to break or will result in infinte loop (retest condition)
  - used when you can't predict the number of loops needed
- do while:
  - similar to while, but statement written in do before the while condition
