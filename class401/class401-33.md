## Redux - Additional Topics

### Review, Research, and Discussion
What’s the best practice for “pre-loading” data into the store (on application start) in a Redux application?
- The best practice is to preload the data using a lifecycle event coupled with thunk middleware to handle the asyncronus http request to an API.

When using a thunk/async action that dispatches the actual action, which do you export from your reducer?
- you are sending an empty function that then when called calls the async function which passes the asyncronus dispatch and getState actions.

### Vocab
**middleware**
- in respect to Redux, middleware is required to use on any asyncronus action you are executing to update state. This is because Redux doesn't wait for asyncronus functions to return.

**thunk**
- thunk is the name of the middleware actions that is required in retreiving data from requests.
