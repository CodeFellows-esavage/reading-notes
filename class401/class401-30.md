## Application State with Redux

### Review, Research, and Discussion
What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”
- Cookies are mainly for being read server side, local storage is for reading client side [source](https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/cookies-vs-local-storage-2f3732c7d977)

Explain 3rd party cookies.
- Third-party cookies are cookies that are set by a website other than the one you are currently on. For example, you can have a "Like" button on your website which will store a cookie on a visitor's computer, that cookie can later be accessed by Facebook to identify visitors and see which websites they visited. Such a cookie is considered to be a 3rd party cookie. [source](https://cookie-script.com/all-you-need-to-know-about-third-party-cookies.html)

How do pixel tags work? [source](https://en.ryte.com/wiki/Tracking_Pixel#How_does_a_tracking_pixel_work)
- A tracking pixel (also called 1x1 pixel or pixel tag) is a graphic with dimensions of 1x1 pixels that is loaded when a user visits a webpage or opens an email.
  - The website operator or sender of an email adds the tracking pixel using a code in the website’s HTML code or email. This code contains an external link to the pixel server. If a user visits the destination website, the HTML code is processed by the client – usually the user’s browser. The browser follows the link and opens the (invisible) graphic. This is registered and noted in the server’s log files.


### Vocab
**cookies** [source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies)
- An HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece of data that a server sends to a user's web browser. The browser may store the cookie and send it back to the same server with later requests. Typically, an HTTP cookie is used to tell if two requests come from the same browser—keeping a user logged in, for example. It remembers stateful information for the stateless HTTP protocol.

Cookies are mainly used for three purposes:
1. Session management - Logins, shopping carts, game scores, or anything else the server should remember
2. Personalization - User preferences, themes, and other settings
3. Tracking - Recording and analyzing user behavior

**authorization**
- Authorization is the function of specifying access rights/privileges to resources, which is related to general information security and computer security, and to access control in particular. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization)

**access control**
- access control is typically implemented through an access control list or ACL. Access control limits how a given user is able interact with an application based on permissions.

**conditional rendering**
- Rendering a component depending on truthyness of a variable or state.
