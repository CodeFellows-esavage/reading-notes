### Review, Research, and Discussion
What’s the difference between PUT and PATCH?
- PUT will update the whole object being modified, where PATCH can just update a specific key value in the object.

Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like json-server
1. [postman](https://www.postman.com/features/mock-api/)
2. [miragejs](https://miragejs.com/)
3. [mockoon](https://mockoon.com/)

Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js
- at a glance it looks like APIDOC.js is more popular and updated more frequently than Swagger

Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?
- view this resource [HTTP Status Codes](https://restfulapi.net/http-status-codes/)

Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST
- [Resource](https://restfulapi.net/soap-vs-rest-apis/)
- SOAP - Simple Object Acess Protocol
   - messaging framework
   - uses SOAP protocol
   - XML data formating
   - typically stateless, but can become stateful
   - higher security
- REST - REpresentational State Transfer 
   - architectural style
   - synonymous with HTTP protocol
   - CSV, JSON or RSS data formating
   - stateless
   - easier to develop

Vocab:
- Web Server - a computer instance that listens for HTTP requests on a given URL.
- Express - an unopinionated Node web framework that gives us access to methods and properties that a server would need to use for a server to respond to requests. (HTTP Server) (resource 1/class notes).
  - unopinionated means there are fewer restrictions how components interact with one another and how the directory is structured.
- Node - runtime environment for JavaScript to allow JavaScript to run on a computer vs a browser
- Routing - allows you to match character patterns in a URL to extract some values from the URL and pass them as parameters (resource 1). You can use use the express.Router object to group similar routes in their own module.
- Middleware - any function that goes between the request and the response. These functions utlize the next parameter to when the request cycle is not completed.
- WRRC - Web Request Response Cycle
- TDD - Test Driven Development
  1. write a test to describe what you want a feature to do
  2. run the test - will fail
  3. write basic code to pass test
  4. refactor code
  5. repeat for each feature
- CI: Continuous Integration - workflow to help ensure new code developed will integrate into the current version of the software
- CD Continuous Delivery - practice of developing software in a way that it could be released at any time
  - continuous deployment - an extension of CD that allows for high confidence deployment of new production features
