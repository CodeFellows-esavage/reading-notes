## Stacks and Queues

Both are data structures that add data and remove it

### Stacks
- Stack is LIFO - dirty dishes stacked, you remove the last one added
- Abstract data collection (more than one way to build this)
- Uses:
  - undo/redo functionality in most software
  - manageing function invocations
  - routing (browser history)
  - tree and graph algorithms

### Queues
- Queue is FIFO - like a line for a ride, first person in line, is first on the ride (out)
- Abstract data collection as well (more than one way to build this)
- Uses:
  - videogame queues
  - background tasks
  - uploading resources
  - printing/task processing (first document sent will be first to print)
