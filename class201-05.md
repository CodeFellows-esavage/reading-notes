## Duckett HTML & CSS:
## Chapter 5: “Images”
<!-- (pp.94-125) -->
Images are used to set the tone of your website and should be relevant, convey information, be recognizable, and fit the color pallet.
- best practice is to store in a separate file location
- added using `<img>`, attributes: src points to the location (web address or file location), alt provides a description for web readers, title (hover details), height and width (typically specified in CSS)
- CSS is used to control alignment of images with other page content
- 3 rules for creating Images:
  1. Select the right format (JPEG, PNG, GIF)
  2. Save images at the exact size desired for display on the website (quicker loading times)
  3. Use pixles for saving proper image size (not cm or in)


## Chapter 11: “Color”
<!-- (pp.246-263) -->
Methods for applying color properties:
1. Color Names - "blue, red, gree, etc"
2. RBG Values - rgb(red_value, green_value, blue_value), value is between 0 and 255
3. RBGA - same as RBG but adds A (0.0 to 1.0) for opacity
4. Hex Codes - #XXXXXX six digit alpha numeric code
5. HSL - hue (angle 0 and 360 degrees), saturation (percentage), and lightness (percentage (0 = white, 100 = black))
6. HSLA - same as HSL but adds A (0.0 to 1.0) for opacity

Aspects of color:
- Hue - another word for color
- Saturation - amount of gray in a color
- Brightness - amount of black in a color
- Contrast - for long spans of text use med contrast, for everything else use high contrast, avoid low contrast
- Opacity - self explanitory
- 

## Chapter 12: “Text” 
<!-- (pp.264-299) -->
Two groups of properties that affect text:
1. Those that directly effect the text appearance (typeface, text size)
2. Those that would have the same effect on text no matter the font (color, wordspacing, letter spacing)

Typeface:
- serif - serifs are the extra details on letters in addition to the main shape
- sans-serif - straight ends to letteres (think cleaner design)
- monospace - every letter has the same width (commonly used for code)
- weight - thickness of the font (light, med, bold, black)
- sytle - normal, italic, oblique
- stretch - condensed (narrow), regular, extended (wide)
- use `font-family` to specify the font you want viewed, with alternatives separated out by commas

Responding to users:
- `:hover` - used to create a hover affect
- `:active` - used when activating an element
- `:focus` - used when an element has focus

[JPEG vs PNG vs GIF](https://blog.imagekit.io/jpeg-vs-png-vs-gif-which-image-format-to-use-and-when-c8913ae3e01d)

Format Specialites:
- JPEG - used for images containing a natural scene or color varation and intensity are smooth
  - Compression is lossy and can be compressed at a ratio of 1:10 with no percieved affect
  - transparency is not supported
  - Supports 16 million colors
- PNG - used when transparency is needed (text, sharp contrast, logos)
  - lossless compression, looks sharper, but takes up more space
  - supports alpha and index transparency
    - alpha - allows edges to blend smoothly with background
    - index transparency - declares a single color as transparent
  - PNG8 supports 256 colors, PNG24 supports 16 million colors
- GIF - used for animations
  - lossless compression
  - supports index transparency
  - limited to 256 colors

Compression:
- many forms on the internet (text, image, video) undergo some form of compression
- There is lossless and lossy compression
  - lossless - no imformation is lost (you can reconstruct original image)
  - lossy - has a supieror compression ratio but is irriversable

Transparency:
- ability to make completely invisible
  
Colors:
-
