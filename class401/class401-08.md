## Access Control (ACL)

### Review, Research, and Discussion
When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?
 - basic authorization requires you to send and use the encrypted user name and password to each endpoint to validate, also basic authorization is server side. 
 - bearer authorization provides you a token that is held client side and is used to validate on the server

What does the JSON Web Token package do?
 - allows you to recieve JSON web tokens from the headers and using a Secret phrase read it
 - 
What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?
- the SECRET should be a none human readable that is stored on the server in a secure difficult to access spot, because if someone gets ahold of it they can have access to intercepting tokens and decoding them or authorizing themselves as someone else.

### Vocab
**encryption**
- Encryption is a means of securing data (not human readable) by encoding it mathematically such that it can only be read, or decrypted, by those with the correct key or cipher. [source](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/encryption.asp)

**token**
- a stateless self-contained means of containing all the information for authentication [source](https://auth0.com/learn/token-based-authentication-made-easy/)
**bearer**
- The name “Bearer authentication” can be understood as “give access to the bearer of this token. The bearer is the person who holds the token. (0sou)

**secret**
- this is used to generate the token and must be used to read the token, without this you will be unauthorized.

**JSON Web Token**
- Token consists of three parts: Header, Payload and Signature. [source](https://auth0.com/learn/token-based-authentication-made-easy/)
  - The header and payload are Base64 encoded, then concatenated by a period, finally the result is algorithmically signed producing a token in the form of header.claims.signature.
