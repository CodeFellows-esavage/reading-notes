## Local Storage for Web Applications
[Resource](http://diveinto.html5doctor.com/storage.html)

### History
Cookies are a form of local storage for the web, unfortunately they aren't that useful
- Are included with every HTTP request
- Slow down your web application
- Potentially send unecrypted data unless using SSL
- Are limited to 4KB of data, enough to slow, not enough to be useful

Ideal Storage would look like...
- lots of space
- on the client
- exists after page refreshes
- no server transmission

None of the Ideal Storage solutions existed prior to HTML5, instead it was a number of different browser based or 3rd party plugins that had different requirements and generated different user experiences.

### HTML5 Storage
HTML5 Storage:
 - aka WebStorage, Local Storage, DOM Storage
 - allows local storage of key/value pairs even after navigating away from the page/exiting the browser and is never transmitted
 - accessed through JavaScript via `localStorage` object on the global window object
 - offers 5 MB of data storage
 - throws `QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR` if data storage is exceeded

Check whether a browser supports it by writing a function to see if localStorage returns null. Or use Modernizr to detect it:

```
if (Modernizr.localstorage) {
  // window.localStorage is available!
} else {
  // no native support for HTML5 storage :(
  // maybe try dojox.storage or a third-party solution
}
```

Data is stored in Key Value pairs
- stored on key
- retreived with same key
- supports all JavaScript data types
  - when stored all data types are stored as a string
  - need to used functions to convert back to expected type when retrieving
- `setItem()` if key already exisits it will be overwritten
- `getItem()` if retrieving key that doesn't exsist will get null
- methods for call set and get Item:
  
    ```
    var foo = localStorage.getItem("bar");
    OR
    var foo = localStorage["bar"];

    localStorage.setItem("bar", foo);
    OR
    localStorage["bar"] = foo;
    ```
- `removeItem()` remove a key
- get total number of values in storage:
    ```
    interface Storage {
    readonly attribute unsigned long length;
    getter DOMString key(in unsigned long index);
    };
    ```

Storage Area Changes:
- To track changes trap the `storage` event
- the `storage` event is created when `setItem()`, `removeItem()`, or `clear()` are called and actually modify the local storage
  - if the local storage  isn't modified the storage event won't be created
- trapping storage event:
```
if (window.addEventListener) {
window.addEventListener("storage", handle_storage, false);
} else {
window.attachEvent("onstorage", handle_storage);
};
```
- handling storage event:
```
function handle_storage(e) {
  if (!e) { e = window.event; }
}
```
  - e will be a StorageEvent object with the following properties:
    - key - type = string, name of key modified
    - oldValue - type any, previous value
    - newValue - type any, new value
    - url - type string, page that called the method that triggered the modfication
