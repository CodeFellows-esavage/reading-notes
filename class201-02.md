## Duckett HTML & CSS:
### Chapter 2: “Text”
<!-- (pp.40-61) -->
There are a variety of element tags that are used specifically to mark-up text:
- [MDN HTML Elements Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)
- `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<b>`, `<i>`, etc

There are also a variety of semantic tags that can be used to provide additional information for accessability and those reading your code, such as emphasis, acronyms/abbreviations, addresses, citations, quotes, and more.
- see the link above to the MDN HTML Elements Reference to get a full list of semantic elements

### Chapter 10: Ch.10 “Introducing CSS”
<!-- (pp.226-245) -->
CSS allows you to create rules that affect how the website is styled/presented to the user. By referencing specific element types, id's, classes, or combinations of all three you can specifically target HTML elements to precicely control how it looks.
- CSS can be applied to HTML element in-line, in page in the `<head>`, or linked via a `filename.css` external file

```
<link href="filename.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />
```
- `type="text/css"` not required

[CSS Selector Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp)

```
selector {
    target property: value;
}

.selector { = class
#selector { = id
h1, h2, h3 { = multiple at once
header, h1 { = h1 of a specific section, in this case the header
```

### Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops”
 <!-- only up to the section on switch statements (pp.145-162) -->
 Decisions have two components:
 1. An expression which is evaluated and returns a value
 2. A conditional statement that tells it what to do

Evaluating Operators
- `==` equal to, '43' == 43
- `===` strict equals '43' != 43
- `!=` not equals to
- `!==` strict not equals to
- `<` less than
- `>` greater than
- `<=` less than or equal to
- `>=` greater than or equal to

Logical Operators
- `&&` AND
- `||` OR
- `!` NOT

If and if else statements
```
if (condition){
    code to be executed;
}

if (condition1){
    code to execute if condition 1 is true;
} else {
    code to excute if condition 1 is false;
}
```
