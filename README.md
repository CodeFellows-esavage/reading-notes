## About Me...
I’m Erik Savage (he/him), and as of September 24th 2021, am now a former Manufacturing Engineer who has had the opportunity to work on Heavy Duty Trucks, VR Systems, and most recently a Desktop Laser Cutter. I’ll be coding on macOS Big Sur 11.3.1. I'm pivoting careers to better meet my family needs while still engaging in challenging problem solving on a daily basis.
