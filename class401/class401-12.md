## Socket.io

### Review, Research, and Discussion
What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?
- Data is broken dowing into packets to increase data transfer efficiency and enable multiple pathways to one destination. The transmission of data packets travel across networks, taking the shortest path possible. All the packets are then reassembled at the receiving end in the correct order. [source](https://www.techevaluate.com/why-do-we-break-data-into-packets/)

UDP is often refereed to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this?
- User Datagram Protocol is referred to as connectionless because it doesn't require a connection prior to sending data [source](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-User-Datagram-Protocol-called-connectionless)

Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections?
- If it uses different ports

Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers?
- one connection per socket is allowed, but there can be multiple sockets per server

Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection?
- Yes

### Vocab
**Observer Pattern**
- a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing. [source](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/observer)

**Listener**
- Listens for a particular event to be emited and can send a payload (object)

**Event Handler**
- The JavaScript code that invokes a specific piece of code when a particular action happens on an HTML element [source](https://www.toolsqa.com/javascript/event-handlers-in-javascript/)

**Event Driven Programming**
- a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions (mouse clicks, key presses), sensor outputs, or message passing from other programs or threads. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming)

**Event Loop**
- facilitates relationship between Queue and Call Stack; it constantly checks whether or not the call stack is empty. If it is empty, new functions are added from the event queue. If it is not, then the current function call is processed. [source](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-an-event-loop-in-javascript)

**Event Queue**
- responsible for sending new functions to the stack for processing. It follows the queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for execution. [source](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-an-event-loop-in-javascript)

**Call Stack**
- responsible for keeping track of all the operations in line to be executed. Whenever a function is finished, it is popped from the stack. [source](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-an-event-loop-in-javascript)

**Emit/Raise/Trigger**
- methods to trigger events

**Subscribe**
- similar to Promise but instead of using promises it deals with observable events [source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42000883/what-does-the-subscribe-function-do)

**Database**
- Holds data, can be relational (SQL) or object based (mongo). Allows for data persistance.
