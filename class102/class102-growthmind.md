# ðŸŒ± Growth Mindset ðŸŒ±
## Summary
In summary there are two mindset states: growth mindset or fixed mindset. Focusing on a growth mindset allows one to embrace challenges, persist when approached with obstacles, understand that struggling is a function of the learning/problem solving process, peer feedback and criticisms are opportunities to learn (not shut down), and the success of those same peers should be a source of inspiration/aspiration for yourself. It is not expected that you will be in the Growth Mindset 100% of the time, but it is necessary to recognize when you are in the fixed mindset so that you can set forth the shift that needs to happen to make your way back to the growth mindset.
## Staying In Growth Mindset
My top three (3) takeaways I think will be helpful to utilize through-out Code Fellows:
1. When trying to understand/grasp a new concept, I will utilize *"yet..."* to emphasize that I may not immediately grasp the concept now, but I will with time and effort.
2. When facing a hard problem, I will avoid avoidance/instant gratification which can lead to demoralizing/distracting behaviors that don't make any real progress towards the end goal/challenge.
3. Uplift and utilize peers. Use their successes as well as feedback as aspirations for self improvement.
