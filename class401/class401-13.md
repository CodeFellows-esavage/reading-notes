## Message Queues

### Review, Research, and Discussion
What does it mean that web sockets are bidirectional? Why is this useful?
- Bidirectional means that the server can send real-time updates
asynchronously, without requiring the client to submit a request each time. This is useful in videogames, realtime messaging apps, or any other use case where realtime data flow is important.

Does socket.io use HTTP? Why?
- socket.io tries to make a Web Socket connection as it's first priotiry, if that is not available due to browser or firewalls, then it falls back on a HTTP connection as a failsafe. [source](https://socket.io/docs/v4/)
  - also sounds like it might try to make a HTTP request first, when once connected "Upgrade" to a web socket, since if a web socket connection is rejected it can cause a delay of up to 10 seconds for the user. [source](https://www.amx.com/en/site_elements/benefits-and-applications-of-websockets)

What happens when a client emits an event?
- its basically sending a Node.js EventEmitter, for listeners to capture

What happens when a server emits an event?
- works the same way as the client

What happens if a client “misses” an event?
- By default, any event emitted while the Socket is not connected will be buffered until reconnection.

How can we mitigate this?
- by using volitile events or emptying the internal buffer upon reconnection

### Vocab
**Socket**
- A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network. A socket is bound to a port number so that the TCP layer can identify the application that data is destined to be sent to. [source](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/networking/sockets/definition.html)

**Web Socket**
- A web socket is a communication protocol, that unlike HTTP is bidirectional. It starts with ws:// or wss:// and is stateful, meaning it will stay active until terminated. [source](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-web-socket-and-how-it-is-different-from-the-http/)

**Socket.io**
- Socket.IO is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between the browser and the server [source](https://socket.io/docs/v4/)

**Client**
- A computer accessing a server.

**Server**
- dedicated computer or computer that plays a role to provide services to clients

**OSI Model**
- Open Systems Interconnection (not currently used on Internet) [source](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/layers-of-osi-model/)
- ![OSI Model](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/computer-network-osi-model-layers.png)

**TCP Model**
- Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol 4 layers:
- Process/Application Layer
- Host-to-Host/Transport Layer
- Internet Layer
- Network Access/Link Layer
- [source](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-ip-model/)

**TCP**
- a connection-oriented protocol. Connection-orientation means that the communicating devices should establish a connection before transmitting data and should close the connection after transmitting the data. [source](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-between-tcp-and-udp/)

**UDP**
- Datagram-oriented protocol. This is because there is no overhead for opening a connection, maintaining a connection, and terminating a connection. UDP is efficient for broadcast and multicast types of network transmission. [source](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-between-tcp-and-udp/)

**Packets**
- are used to break data down into smaller pieces for faster transmission, which is then reassembled upon reciept
