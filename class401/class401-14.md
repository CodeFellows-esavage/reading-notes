## Event Driven Architecture

### Review, Research, and Discussion
Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
- Standard queues provide at-least-once delivery, which means that each message is delivered at least once. FIFO queues provide exactly-once processing, which means that each message is delivered once and remains available until a consumer processes it and deletes it.

How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
- By waiting for an emitted confirmation message for the client.

What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?
- Not entirely sure what design patter is best represented by event driven programming, but here are two I found: Mediator Topology and Broker Topology. [source](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/software-architecture-patterns/9781491971437/ch02.html)

How do you test an event driven system?
- seems like the best way to test an event driven system is by implementing logging at all of the various points as well as by using distributed tracing, which is designed to monitor the complete activity path of a transaction throughout the entire system.

### Vocab
**FIFO Queue**
- FIFO represents first in first out, meaning the first value entered into the queue should be the first value extracted. With new values added at the back. Think of it as a tunnel, values can only enter from the back and exit through the front.

**Pub/Sub**
- Pub is a concept for publish, which means to emit an event for other clients or the server to hear
- Sub is a concept to subscribe, which means to listen on an event that the server is emiting.
