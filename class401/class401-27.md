## `<Login />` and `<Auth />`

### Review, Research, and Discussion
Why is the Context API useful?
- The context API allows you to provide state to your entire react app without needing to pass it down through each individual component. This is especially helpful when the state being used needs to be consumed by many components.

Can a component outside of a provider get its context?
- No, the component or its parent needs to be wrapped in the provider element.

What are some common use cases for using the Context API?
- Common uses cases are user settings, theme, and authentication
