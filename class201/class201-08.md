## Duckett HTML & CSS:
### Chapter 15, “Layout” 
<!-- (again; repeat of Class 4 reading) -->

CSS treats element as its own box that is either inline or block-level.
- block-level elements that have another block-level element nested inside are considered its parent or containing element

Positioning of Elements:
- Normal Flow - default behavior, every block level element sits below the previous one, regardless of width
- Relative Positioning - shifts it to a side depending on the css, doesn't affect other elements
  - `position: relative`
- Ablsolute Positioning - positions element in relation to containing element, moves as the user scrolls up and down, other elments ignore this one
  - `position: absolute`
- Fixed Positioning - absolute positioning but relative to the browser window vs containing element
  - `position: fixed`
- Floating Elements - takes element out of normal flow and positions it inside of its containing element, other content will flow around it
  - `float: direction`
  - use float to place text or images side by side
  - make multi column text using classes and width with float
- use the z-index when encountering overlapping elements

Screen resolutions vary greatly depending on the device used to view the website.

Layout Types:
- Fixed Width - do not change size with browser window resizing (favor pixle sizing)
- Liquid - designs stretch and shrink as the browser window is resized (favor % sizing)
- Grids - grid structure is used to layout items on a page
  - 960.gs css framework can be used to get a grid stylesheet
