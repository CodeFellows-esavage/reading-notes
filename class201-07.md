Domain Modeling - process of creating a model in code for a problem.

The constructor function is a function that can be used to create an object model and then construct new objects based off of that model by passing in values for the pre-defined properties.
- Example:
  ```
  const EpicFailVideo = function(epicRating, hasAnimals) {
  this.epicRating = epicRating;
  this.hasAnimals = hasAnimals;
  }

  let parkourFail = new EpicFailVideo(7, false);
  let corgiFail = new EpicFailVideo(4, true);
  ```
The example above intiates two new EpicFailVideo objects with the assoicated epicRating, and has Animals boolean, by using the `new` keyword.

Object prototypes can be used as doubles for objects to call methods. If a function isn't directly in an object is searched its prototypes next.
- this takes longer
- this is JS best practice
- when a prototype is shared between more than one object, it uses less memory 

Tips (from resource above):
1. When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
2. Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
3. Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
4. Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
5. Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
6. Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside

## Duckett HTML & CSS:
### Chapter 6: “Tables” 
<!-- (pp.126-145) -->
Tables are great for displaying information in a grid...

List of Table Commands:
- `<table>` - element used to create a table
- `<tr>` - represents each row (contained in `<table>`)
- `<td>` - represents each cell (contained in `<tr>`)
- `<th>` - table heading (contained in `<tr>`) think data labels,
- use empty `<th>` or `<td>` elements to represent blank cells when needed
- attribute colspan="num_col" inside of `<td>` element to create data that spans more than one column
- attribute rowspan="num_row" inside of `<td>` element to create data that spans more than one row
- `<thead>` - semantic heading of the table, will contain `<th>` elements, think top data labels
- `<tbody>` - semantic body of the table, think containing main data
- `<tfoot>` - semantic footer of the table, think containing summary data like total
  - use the 3 above with long tables

## Duckett JAVASCRIPT & JQUERY:
### Chapter 3: “Functions, Methods, and Objects” 
<!-- (pp.106-144) -->

New Keyword:
- can be used to intialize new objects
  - `const object_name = new Object ();`
  - add properties using dot notation
    - `object_name.property_name = value;`
    - `object_name['property_name'] = value;`
      - both notations above work the same

Delete Keyword:
- delete a property from an object
  - `delete object_name.property_name;`

Constructor Objects:
- see page 108 in book, also reference Domain Modeling reading above
- create several objects to represent similar things
- use a function as a template
  - each parameter or arugment of the function represents a desired property for the object
  - new objects are then created using the template function and passing in values to each parameter
    - use new keyword

this Keyword:
- represents the object it is called in

Arrays are objects that use an index as it's key vs a property.

Built-in Objects - 3 Groups:
1. Browser Object Model - model of the browser tab or window
2. Document Object Model - model of current web page
3. Global JavaScript Objects - not a single model, language related
