## Component-Based Architecture
- [Source](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm)

Component:
- Functionality that has been made modular/resuable that can be implemented at a higher level interface
- Software Objects that interface with other components
- Can be deployed independently
- Can be one of three views:
  1. Object-oriented, component is built from a class
  2. Conventional, component is a functional element or module
  3. Process-related, system building from a library

Component Characteristics:
- Reusable, often components are designed to be reused
- Replaceable, can be swapped with other similar components
- Not context specific, see Resuable, they are designed be reused in different contexts
- Extensible, new behaviors can be added
- Encapsulated, internal processes, variables, or states cannot be accessed where called
- Independent, minimal dependencies on other components

Advantages:
- Ease of Deployment, easy to update and deploy similar components as new versions are made available
- Reduced Cost, cost and development time is reduced using 3rd party components
- Ease of Development, introduce well defined functionality without impacting other parts of the system
- Reuseable, can be reused
- Reliable, as components are made more reliable the reliability of the whole system that relies on these compoents is improved
- Independent, can be worked on independently from the system in which they are used
- Maintenance and Evolution, easy to update without affecting the broader system



## Props and React
- [Source](https://itnext.io/what-is-props-and-how-to-use-it-in-react-da307f500da0#:~:text=%E2%80%9CProps%E2%80%9D%20is%20a%20special%20keyword,way%20from%20parent%20to%20child)

Props:
- `Props` is a keyword used in React libraries to send data between two components when they need to communicate
  - Note: 
  - this data is passed in ONE direction, from parent to child
  - this data is READ ONLY, which means child components should not modify it
- Props AKA (properties) are the arguements passed into a React component similar to how an argument can be passed into a function
- Props are passed into childcomponents as objects
