[Section Source](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

- **Roy Fielding** - helped write the first web servers, and his name is on the specification for the HTTP protocal that is used to get pages from servers to browsers.
- **HTTP** - is able to describe the location of something anywhere in the world **from** anywhere in the world

REST:
- Architecture the web is build on that provides a definition of a resource
- APIs allow machines to use the web like people do
- Built on applying verbs to nouns
  - `GET` retreives resources from the web (websites, images, text, video, etc)
  - `POST` allows one system to add to another system
  - `PUT` replace something in another system
  - `PATCH` partial update
