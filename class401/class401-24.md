## Hash Tables

### Intro
- hash tables are also known as hash maps
- hash tables are used to store key value pairs
  - keys are not ordered
- fast for...
  - finding values, adding new values, and removing values
- nearly ever language has a sort of hash table data structure
  - Python = Dictionaries
  - JS = Objects & Maps
  - Java|Go|Scala = Maps
  - Ruby = Hashes
- becuase of speed, they are commonly used
- uses human readable keys

### Hashing Algorithm
- need to convert human readable string into a number using hash functions
- should be deterministic: pass in a string and return the same number everytime (that will then be used as the index to store the key value pair in an array.)
- needs to be fast (constant time) to read and write
- shouldn't cluster outputs at specific indices (say in the mean )
