## Authentication

### OAuth
- [CSO Article](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3216404/what-is-oauth-how-the-open-authorization-framework-works.html)

- SSO - Single Sign-On
- OAuth is an open-standard **authorization** protocol/framework that details how unrelated servers and services can safely allow authenticated access to their assets without actually sharing the original logon credential.
  - AKA secure 3rd party user-agent, delegated authorization
  - an example of this is when a website allows you to login using your google account
- OAuth only works using HTTPS
- How OAuth Works
  1. website (A) connects to website (B) on behalf of user using OAuth
  2. website (B) generates a single use **request** token and secret
  3. website (A) provides  **request** token and secret to user's client software
  4. client software presents **request** token and secret to to authorization provider
  5. if not authenticated, client is asked to authenticate then client is asked to approve authorization transaction to website (B)
  6. user approves transaction at website (A)
  7. user gets approved **access** token
  8. user gives approved **access** token to website (A)
  9. website (A) gives approved **access** token to website (B) as proof of user authentication
  10. website (B) allows website (A) to access site on behalf of user
  11. user see successful transaction
- OpenID is about **authentication**, where OpenID Connect is now an **authentication layer** for OAuth
- Summary by StackOverflow user pithily: "OpenID is for humans logging into machines, OAuth is for machines logging into machines on behalf of humans."

### Authorization and Authentication Flows
- [Auth0 docs](https://auth0.com/docs/flows)

- **Authentication** is *the process of a user/subject proving its ownership of a presented identity*, by providing a password or some other uniquely owned or presented factor.
- **Authorization** is *the process of letting a subject access resources* after a successful authentication, oftentimes somewhere else.
- Authorization Code Flow - exchanges Authorization for a token for server-side apps
- Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) - Authorization Code Flow for mobile and native applications
Implicit Flow with Form Post - alternative to Authorization Code Flow for Public Clients (not best practice)
Client Credentials Flow - Machine to Machine (M2M) authentication and authorization
Device Authorization Flow - device asks user to authenticate via a link on computer or smartphone
Resource Owner Password Flow - credentials provided via form (not recommended)
