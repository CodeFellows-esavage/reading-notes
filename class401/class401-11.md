## Event Driven Applications

### Review, Research, and Discussion
Why is access control important?
- Access control minimizes the risk of authorized access to physical and computer systems, forming a foundational part of information security, data security and network security. [source](https://www.upguard.com/blog/access-control)

Describe an application that would need access control.
- Any site that is managing a user base is likely going to require some type of access control.

What is a role used for?
 - A role is used to define a set of permissions that a specific group or job function that requires a specific set of access rules. (HR, admin, engineer, sales, etc)
  
Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?
- RBAC is more scalable than DAC and MAC becuse you are assigning a general group a certain privialge vs individual persons or devices. [source](https://www.upguard.com/blog/access-control)

### Vocab
**Authorization**
- Authroization is the permission granted to a system once authenticated.

**Role Based Access Control**
- Role Based Access Control (RBAC) allows you to create and enforce access by assigning a set of permissions to what each specific user or user groupe can and cannot do.

**Capabilities**
- Is another name for a key/token in an authentication system. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security)
