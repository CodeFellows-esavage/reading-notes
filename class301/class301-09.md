## Functional Programming
[Section Source](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa)

Definition: Functional programming is a programming model that builds the structure and elements of programs where computation is the evaluation of mathematical functions while avoiding changing-state and mutable data.

Pure Functions:
- Purity:
  - returns the same result given the same arguement (aka deterministic)
  - does not cause obeservable side effects
    - exmaple of observable side effects is increasing the count on a global variable by incrementing the variable inside of the function.
  - passes global objects in as parameters instead of calling them directly inside of the function
  - doesn't read external files
  - doesn't rely on random number generation
- Benefits:
  - code is easier to test
  - doesn't need to mock anything
  - can test with different contexts

Immutability:
- immutable data cannot change its state after it is created
  - you need to create a new object and assign a new value
- recursion can be used to keep our variables immutable

Referential Transparency:
- if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input it is referentially transparent
- this allows for memoizing the function (optimization)
  - replacing the entire expression with a number constant is memoizing

## Node.js Modules and require()
[Section Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHLd36QoS4k)

Module - spliting node.js code into separate js files and calling on those files when needed.

Require
- is on the global object in node.js so it can be accessed from anywhere
- allows functions from other files to be accessed
- `const variableName = require('./filepath');` don't need .js on the end, it will account for it automatically
- inorder for these file to be accessed in addition to require, they need to be exported `module.exports = functionName ` similarly to React components

## Things I want to know more about:
- writing pure functions, and memonizing -- Hard to understand the benefit with the simple example they displayed.
