### Tansforms:
Tranforms provide alternative ways to size and position elements.

Sytanx:
```
div {
  -webkit-transform: scale(1.5);
     -moz-transform: scale(1.5);
       -o-transform: scale(1.5);
          transform: scale(1.5);
}
```
- include multiple vendor prefixes to get support across all browsers
  
- `rotate` - rotate element 0 to 360degrees
- `scale` - make element smaller or bigger
  - scaleX scaleY do it in their respective directions
- `translate` - works like relative positioning
  - translateX moves on horizontal axis
  - translateY moves on vertical axis
  `skew` - distort elements in horizontal or vertical axis
  - these all be combined

### Transitions
For a transition to take place an element must have a change in state.

Four transition properties
- transition-property - identify proerty of element to change
- transition-duration - time of transition
- transition-timing-function - set the speed
- transition-delay - add a delay

Transition property has three (3) values:
1. properties to transition
2. speed
3. acceleration/deceleration

Eight Great Transitions:
1. Fade In
2. Change Color
3. Grow and Shrink
4. Rotate Elements
5. Square to Circle
6. 3D Shadow
7. Swing
8. Inset Border

### Animations
Are used to build out animations from one state to another.
- keyframes set multiple points
- name assigns keyframe to an element
- animations can be customized further with other properties
  - iteration
  - direction
  - play state
  - fill mode
