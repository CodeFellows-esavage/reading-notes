2. Vue
3. Svelte
4. Lit

Whatâ€™s the difference between a framework and a library?
- With a framework you need to code how the framework requires you to inorder for it to work. A library typically allows you to code how you want and incorporate the bits and pieces of the library into your code.
- When you use a library, you are in charge of the flow of the application. You are choosing when and where to call the library. When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. It provides some places for you to plug in your code, but it calls the code you plugged in as needed.

### Vocab
**Rendering**
- how elements and ultimate components are displayed on the page. React uses a render method ReactDOM.render() to accomplish this.

**Templates**
- React templates (or React dashboards) are sets of ready-to-use parts of code built using React technology for the development of dynamic user interfaces. [source](https://flatlogic.com/blog/what-is-react-template-react-template-definition/#one)

**State**
- State allows you to manage dynamic data in React. Can be passed down from a parent component to a child component, through properties (props), but cannot be passed from a child to a parent.
