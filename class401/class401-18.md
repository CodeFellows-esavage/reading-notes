## AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

### Review, Research, and Discussion
Describe a use case for a serverless function.
- Coca-cola uses serverless functions to handle payments from their vending machines, this way they are only paying for computation time per request rather than having a server running non-stop. [source](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/serverless-functions)

If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it?
- I would use websockets and each function would have a unqiue emission call/listener to execute the function as a callback.

Describe how a CDN works
- CDN determines how close you are to a server and provides you information from closest server.



### Vocab
**Serverless Functions**
- Serverless functions utlized cloud computing/processing power to execute one specific task
- Serverless functions are a single-purpose, programmatic feature of serverless computing — also simply called “serverless” — a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider provisions computing resources on demand for its customers and manages all architectures, including cloud infrastructure.

**Cloud Storage**
- Cloud Storage utilizes hard drives to store data and provide the data as needed to the person requesting it. This is typically built and sold as a service with amount of space required as the key pricing component.
- Cloud storage is a cloud computing model that stores data on the Internet through a cloud computing provider who manages and operates data storage as a service.[source](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-storage/)

**CDN**
- Content Delivery Network - a network of servers that delivers content to users based on their proximity to the server. [source](https://bloggingwizard.com/content-delivery-networks-explained/)
