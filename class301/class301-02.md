## React Lifecycle
- [Source](https://medium.com/@joshuablankenshipnola/react-component-lifecycle-events-cb77e670a093)

Lifecyle Events:
 -  Methods that are able to be performed on class components or function components
 -  Lifecyle events (methods) can be called during the lifecycle of a component to update UI or application states
    -  A component has three (3) Lifecycle Phases:
        1. **Mounting** - when an instance of the component is created and inserted into the DOM
         - lifecyle events (in order):
           1. Constructor
           2. (static) getDerivedStateFromProps -  state relies on changes in props over time
           3. render() - REQUIRED method in class component, examines this.props and this.state
           4. componentDidMount() - invoked as soon as component is mounted, used to load anything using a network request or initialize the DOM
        2. **Updating** - when a compontent is updated, changes state or is rerendered
         - lifecyle events (in order):
           1. (static) getDerivedStateFromProps  
           2. shouldComponentUpdate() - used (set to false) to prevent default React behavior of rerendering after every state change
           3. render() - see above
           4. getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() - captures picture of DOM to check prior to updating DOM
           5. componenDidUpdate() - used to perform network requests after a change  
        3. **Unmounting** - when a component is removed from the DOM
         - lifecyle events (in order):
           1. componentWillUnmount() - used to clean up the DOM, network requests, and subscriptions

## React State vs Props
- [Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYvD9oBCuJI)

State:
- handled INSIDE of a component
- is updated inside of a component
- when changed, that component is rerendered
- used to change or rerender your application based on a user input
- examples:
  - count
  - forms input elements, checkboxes, etc

Props:
 - handled OUTSIDE of a component
 - passed into a component similar to arguments to a function
 - must be updated outside of a component (can't change within a component)
 - examples:
   - titles/headers that don't need to be updated
