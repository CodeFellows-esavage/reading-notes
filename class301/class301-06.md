## Node.js Intro
[Section Source](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js)

Node.js (Current Installed Version: v14.18.0):
- Definition: JavaScript Runtime (can execute code directly on a computer) that is built off of Google Chromes V8 JS Engine.
  - the Chrome V8 JS Engine is what takes written JavaScript code and compiles it into executable code.
- since node only runs on one runtime (V8) you don't have to worry about compatibility issues with other engines.
- Uses:
  - installing and running various build tools
  - running JavaScript on the server
    - **Benefits:**
    - Node.js is **event driven**, so if a blocking event occurs Node.js will generate a callback and move onto processing the next event. Once the blocking event has finished the server will execute the callback and continue working on the original event.
      - long story short: very little server overhead
      - you can clone a Node.js app to share the workload in order to scale
    - **Downsides:**
    - single threaded
  - well suited for real time interactions/collaboration
  - handling a lot of I/O driven requests
  - data streaming
  - scripting language to automate tasks
  - writing a command line tool
  - cross-platform desktop apps
- Advantages:
  - scalability
  - Front End/Back End are written in the same language
  - it can understand JSON and pass it cleanly from Front End to Back End
  - "easy to learn"


Npm: (Current Installed Version: 6.14.15)
- Definition: the JavaScript package manager, which is also the world's largest software registry with over 1 million packages of JS code available for download
  - to install a library/package called 'jshint':
    ```
    npm install -g jshint
    ```

## Pair Programming
[Section Source](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

**Pair programming** allows you to focus on improving listening, speaking, reading, and writing, all while still learning to code!

6 Reasons for pair programming:

1. Greater Efficiency
- while it make take longer up front, the code developed is usually higher quality
2. Engaged Collaboration
- when working with someone you are both focused and less easily distracted
3. Learning From Fellow Students
- exposure to different problem solving styles and techniques
4. Social Skills
- getting comfortable talking
5. Job Interview Readiness
- learning to talk to and through code
6. Work Environment Readiness
- this is a common practice in the workplace and its worth knowing
