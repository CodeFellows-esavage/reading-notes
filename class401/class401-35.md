## Ethics

### My thoughts on "Ethics in the workplace”
One key phrase that stood out to me when reading on this topic was "As developers, we are often one of the last lines of defense against potentially dangerous and unethical practices." This really connected with me. Similar to Engineering ethics with mechanical engineering, it is our duty as software engineers to use our moral compass to ensure what we are coding is ethically sound. If I should ever come across this professionally I would rather push back then execute the code and have regrets later.


### My thoughts on “Ethics in Technology”
The amount of data being produced and collected each year is increasing at a rapid pace. This in of it'self isn't necessarily a big issue, but that fact that regulations in how the data is used aren't quite defined or rigourus enough. In order to improve this, as a software developer, I can do my part to ensure that data is only used where it is applicable. An example would be song preferences being used for song recommendations only, vs, maybe making assumptions for dating compatibility or banking.
