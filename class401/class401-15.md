## Trees

### Overview
Both are data structures that consist of nodes in a parent child relationship, that have branching structures. Each node can point to more than one node.
 - the single node at the top is refered to as the `ROOT`
 - trees are nonlinear
 - nodes can only point to child, every node moves away from the root node
 - can only have one root
 - parent node above a child
 - child is a node connected to another node when moving away from the root
 - siblings nodes that share the same parent
 - leaf nodes with no childeren
 - edge the connection between one node and another

### Applications
- HTML DOM is a tree structure
  - source code, looking at the various elements in the console
- Network routing
- Abstract Syntax
- Artifical Intelligence (minimax tree)
- Folders in an Operating System
- JSON view (in browser)

### Tree Types
- trees
- binary trees, each node can have at most **two** childeren
- binary search trees, special case of binary tree
  - sorted (usually numbers) in a particular order 
  - every number less than the root are to the left, greater than are to the right, this holds true for all parent childeren nodes
- many many many more than this

### Binary Search Trees (BST)
Classes
  - node will have value, left, and right
  - BST will have root
