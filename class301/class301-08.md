## API Design Best Practices
[Section Source](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/api-design)

Proper API Design Allows for:
- Platform Independance 
  - API and the Client should have an agreedupon method of communicating 
- Service Evolution 
  - new features can be added without breaking any existing functionality 
  - these new features should be discoverable

REST - Representational State Transfer

RESTful API's Principles (using HTTP):
- REST APIs are designed around resources (objects, data, or services) that can be accessed by a client
- Each resource as an identifier that identifies it
  - this is a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)
  - `https://my-fake-api.com/example/URIs`
  - URIs should be based on nouns (the resource) and not verbs (operations on the resource) (above is a good example)
    - adopt consistent naming conventions
    - use collections and hierarchy
    - provide navigable links to associated resources
    - keep URIs simple
- Avoid chatty APIs which are APIs that send numorous small requests

HTTP Common Verbs:
- GET - retrieves a representation of resource at given URI, message body contains details of resource
  - returns 200 OK, or 404 (Not Found) if resource can't be found
- POST - creates a new resources at a given URI, message body contains details of new resource, can also be used to trigger operations that don't generate a new resource
  - returns 200 , no result to return 204, invalid data 400
- PUT - creates OR replaces a resource at a given URI, body of request specifies targeted resource
  - new resource returns code 201
  - updated resource returns code 200 OK, 204 NO Content, or 490 Conflict
- PATCH - partial update of resource
- DELETE - removes resource at a given URI
  - sucessful delete returns 204 No Content or 404 if it didn't exisit
