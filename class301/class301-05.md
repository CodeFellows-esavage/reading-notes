## Thinking In React
[Section Source](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)

Steps for Designing In React:
1. Develop a Component Hierarchy
   - draw boxes around each component and sub-component and assign names
   - use the ***single responsibility principle*** - each component should only do one (1) thing, if a component starts handling too much it should be broken down into sub-components
     - UI and data models tend to both follow the same information architecture
     - each component should match one piece of your data model
2. Build a Static Version
   - component hierarchy uses data model and render the UI
   - no interactivity
     - use only props, do not create any state
     - render() is the only method
   - results in library of reusable components
3. Identify MVP of UI State
   - need minimal set of mutable state required to have functioning app
   - DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself
   - determining state:
    1. passed via props? ❌ state
    2. unchanged over time? ❌ state
    3. computable by other state or props? ❌ state
4. Identify Where the State Lives
   - determine which component mutates or owns each state
   - remember React is one-way data flow
   - foreach(state)
     - identify each component that renders something based on the state
     - find common parent component
     - state should live in common parent or even higher in hiearchy
     - if common parent doesn't exist, make one
5. Inverse Data Flow
   - use callbacks to update state where required from child components


## Higher-Order Functions
[Section Source](https://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html#h_xxCc98lOBK)

Higher-Order Functions - functions that operate on other functions by using them as arguments or returning them.

Greater than function:
```
function greaterThan(n) {
  return m => m > n;
}
let greaterThan10 = greaterThan(10);
console.log(greaterThan10(11));
// → true
```
- takes in a number n
- returns an arrow function that takes an argument m and compares it to n using greater than

Higher-Order Functions are great for handling data
- built in methods like filter() utilize an array and a built in test to test against that array.
- `map()` functions by applying a function to all of the elements arguement array
  - the application of the this function to transform data and push into a new array makes map a higher-order function
- `reduce()` builds a value by repeatedly combining a single element from an array with the current value
  - it does this with array, combination function, and start value parameters
