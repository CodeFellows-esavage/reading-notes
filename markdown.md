# Markdown
## Summary
Markdown is a markup language, and is utlized by most places on Github. This means you can use this syntax to modify how content (text, links, images etc.) is displayed to the end user in the browser.

Resources utlized in the creation of this page:
- [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- [Writing on Github](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github)

## Headings
In their simplest form, headings can be used to create an organized strutured flow for how a user consumes the information displayed on page. There are six (6) different heading sizes which are noted by using the # symbol. Using one (1) # symbol provides the largest available heading, where as using six (6) # symbols (######) will provide the smallest available heading.

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6

## Text
Text shows up as written. There are a few modifiers that can be added to make the text *italic*, **bold**, or ~~strikethrough~~. There are a few ways to do this, but I will show one here.
 - itallic: *example* place one (1) asterisk * before and after a word or phrase containing the desired content to be modified.
 - bold: **example** place two consecutive asterisks ** before and after a word or phrase containing the desired content to be modified.
 - strikethrough: ~~example~~ place two consecutive tildes ~~ before and after a word or phrase containing the desired content to be modified.
 - the above modifiers can utlized in any combination

Bonus, markdown supports emojis which can be used to add a little bit of extra flair or emphasis. To do this, use two (2) pairs of colens surround a Github supported emoji.
- example: :github-supported-emoji: ðŸ˜„
- supported [emjoi cheat sheet](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md)
## Links/pictures
Example: my favorite site is [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com)
- [link text in brackets](Link url in paranthasis')
- adding ! in front of [] allows you to use the same format to post a picture from a web url
  - no way to adjust image size
## Lists
Adding a hypen followed by a space and some text, creates an unordered list item that will display as bulleted when viewed in the browser.
- unordered list item 1
- unordered list item 2
- unordered list item 3

1. ordered list item 1
2. ordered list item 2
3. ordered list item 3
