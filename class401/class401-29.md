## Graphs

### Intro
- Uses:
  - Social Networks, Recommendation Engines (Netflix, "people also watched"), Location Mapping, Routing Algorithms, Visual Heirarchy
- A graph is a collection of nodes and connections between those nodes
- There is no parent node, all nodes are treated equally

### Construction
1. Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices
2. Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
   1. Weighted - when values are assigned to the edges (think maps and distances)
   2. Unweighted - no weights assigned with the edges
   3. Directed - have a direction in how you can traverse between two vertices along an edge (often repesented with arrows) (Instagram)
   4. Undirected - there is no direction (traversal both ways) associated with an edge (FB friends)
3. Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
4. Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.
