### Review, Research, and Discussion
Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”
- "ducks" is a file organization strategy it doesn't actually reduce any of the boiler plate with using Redux to manage state. Whereas Redux Toolkit helps manage the complexities and reduce the boiler plate with global state management.

What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit
- Redux Toolkit package was built to solve for a lot of the boiler plate code required for Redux, limit the installation of other libraries, and complicated configuration setup.


### Vocab
**redux toolkit slices**
- A function that accepts an initial state, an object of reducer functions, and a "slice name", and automatically generates action creators and action types that correspond to the reducers and state. Considered the standard approach to writing Redux Logic. [source](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createslice)

**namespace**
- Namespace refers to the programming paradigm of providing scope to the identifiers (names of types, functions, variables, etc) to prevent collisions between them. For instance, the same variable name might be required in a program in different contexts. [source](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript-namespace/#:~:text=Namespace%20refers%20to%20the%20programming,a%20program%20in%20different%20contexts.)
