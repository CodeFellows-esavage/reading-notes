## Bearer Authorization

### Review, Research, and Discussion
Write the following steps in the correct order:
1. Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
2. Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
3. Make a request to a third-party API endpoint
4. Receive authorization code
5. Make a request to the access token endpoint
6. Receive access token
7. Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint

What can you do with an authorization code?
- with an authorization code you can, once validated, grant an access token

What can you do with an access token?
- with an access token an application can make requests on the user's behalf for authentication.

Whatâ€™s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?
- OAuth provides much higher security and is widely used standard

### Vocab
**Client ID**
- a public identifier for apps that is typically a 32-character hex string so it is not guessable. [source](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/client-registration/client-id-secret/)

**Client Secret**
- a secret key that is only known to the application and the authorization server, should not be guessable, often used with 256 bit encryption converted to hexidecmical representation. [source](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/client-registration/client-id-secret/)

**Authentication Endpoint**
- sed to interact with the resource owner and get the authorization to access the protected resource [source](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/protocols/oauth)
**Access Token Endpoint**
- The token endpoint is where apps make a request to get an access token for a user [source](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/)

**API Endpoint**
- endpoints that the API can redirect to

**Authorization Code**
- authorization codes are granted when an application exchanges an authorization code for an access token at the access token end point. [source](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/authorization-code-request/)
**Access Token**
- is a generated string that applications use to make API requests on behalf of the user. The token represents the authorization of a specific application to access specific parts of a users data. [source](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/)
